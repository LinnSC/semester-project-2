## Description

This is the semester project of the third semester of Front-end Development at Noroff. The goal of this semester project was to create an e-commerce website that had both customer-facing and admin sections.

In my project I created a vintage online store selling vintage luxury items such as bags, shoes and jewelry. The website is called Pre Loved, and has a list of all the products, a product spesific page and a shopping cart. The admin section includes adding, editing and deleting products.
