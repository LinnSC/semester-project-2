## Description

This is the semester project of the third semester of Front-end Development at Noroff. The goal of this semester project was to create an e-commerce website that had both customer-facing and admin sections.
<br>
In my project I created a vintage online store, called "Pre Loved", selling vintage luxury items such as bags, shoes and jewelry. 
<br>

### Visitor site
The visitor site consists of a home page featuring "New in". It also has a product page, with a product spesific page. The user can also shop the items by puting the products in a shopping cart. Users can also contact the store to request waiting list for an item. 

### Admin section
To get into the admin section you have to log in. Here you can add, edit and delete products.
